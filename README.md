## Github Repo Size Checker
This command line application takes a GitHub repository URL and outputs the approximate size of the repository. Note that this size is approximate and may not be exact due to various factors such as compression and file system overhead.

## Installation & Usage

To use this application, you don't need to have any specific programming language or package manager installed on your system.

- Download the executable file for your operating system from the [releases page](https://github.com/blackmonk13/repos-size/releases).
- Unzip the downloaded file to a directory of your choice.
- Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the directory where you unzipped the file.
- Run the github-repo-size executable followed by the GitHub repository URL:


```
repo-size https://github.com/user/repo
```

Note: If you are using Windows, you may need to add the directory containing the github-repo-size executable to your system's PATH environment variable for it to be accessible from anywhere in the command prompt.
